This comprehensive code provides a foundation for a Django-based microservices architecture, supporting sales and notification functionalities with endpoints for CRUD operations. The system is modular, maintainable, and follows best practices for security and performance.

Future enhancements can include the implementation of the anomaly detection service and integration with Azure Cognitive Services, CI/CD pipeline setup, and further development of the notification services using tools like Twilio.
